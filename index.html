    <p>You think I'd leave your side, baby
        You know me better than that
        You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees
        I wouldn't do that
        I'll tell you, you're right when you want
        Ah, ah-ah
        Ah-ah, ah-ooh-ooh
        And if only you could see into me
        Oh, when you're cold, I'll be there
        Hold you tight to me
        When you're on the outside, baby, and you can't get in
        I will show you, you're so much better than you know
        When you're lost, and you're alone, and you can't get back again
        I will find you, darling, and I will bring you home
        And if you want to cry, I am here to dry your eyes, ooh
        And in no time, you'll be fine
        You think I'd leave your side, baby
        You know me better than that
        You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees
        I wouldn't do that
        I'll tell you, you're right when you want
        Ah, ah-ah
        Ah-ah, ah-ooh-ooh
        And if only you could see into me
        Oh, when you're cold, I'll be there
        Hold you tight to me (to me, yeah)
        Oh, when you're low
        I'll be there by your side, baby (by your side, baby)
        Oh, when you're cold, I'll be there
        Hold you tight to me (to me, yeah)
        Oh, when you're low
        I'll be there by your side, baby</p>
