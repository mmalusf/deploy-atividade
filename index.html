    <h1>By Your Side</h1>
    <p>You think I'd leave your side, baby<br>
        You know me better than that<br>
        You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees<br>
        I wouldn't do that<br>
        I'll tell you, you're right when you want<br>
        Ah, ah-ah<br>
        Ah-ah, ah-ooh-ooh<br>
        And if only you could see into me<br>
        Oh, when you're cold, I'll be there<br>
        Hold you tight to me<br>
        When you're on the outside, baby, and you can't get in<br>
        I will show you, you're so much better than you know<br>
        When you're lost, and you're alone, and you can't get back again<br>
        I will find you, darling, and I will bring you home<br>
        And if you want to cry, I am here to dry your eyes, ooh<br>
        And in no time, you'll be fine<br>
        You think I'd leave your side, baby<br>
        You know me better than that<br>
        You think I'd leave you down when you're down on your knees<br>
        I wouldn't do that<br>
        I'll tell you, you're right when you want<br>
        Ah, ah-ah<br>
        Ah-ah, ah-ooh-ooh<br>
        And if only you could see into me<br>
        Oh, when you're cold, I'll be there<br>
        Hold you tight to me (to me, yeah)<br>
        Oh, when you're low<br>
        I'll be there by your side, baby (by your side, baby)<br>
        Oh, when you're cold, I'll be there<br>
        Hold you tight to me (to me, yeah)<br>
        Oh, when you're low<br>
        I'll be there by your side, baby</p>
